Task:
Look at the following programs

x = 0

3.times do 
  x += 1
end
puts x

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

Question:
What does x print to the screen Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why? 

My original Answer:
For the first problem x is equal to 0 because it is using
the using the value of x outside of the method invocation

The second problem prints 3 because although y is assigned to x
in the method invocation, y's value was originally assigned outside
the method invocation

Correct Answer:
I was wrong about problem x. Incrementing x by 1 within the times
iteration saved its value to the variable outside its scope

I was correct about problem 2. The value of x was changed to the value of y

I answered the first one correct this time. The reason we the value of x changes to three is because the local variable was initialized and declared outside of the scope of the .times method invocation.

For the second problem my Original "Correct Answer" was wrong too! x will throw an error because x was not created outside of the scope of the .times method before assigning the value of y within the method's scope.
