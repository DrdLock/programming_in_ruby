Question:

When you run the following code...

def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
     puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
end
equal_to_four(5)

you get the following error message...

exercise.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end

Why did you get this error and how can you fix it?
-------------------------------------------------------

answer: This error message was caused by 
        not closing the if statement properly,
        You can add an end on the next line after 
        the call to puts and it will work
