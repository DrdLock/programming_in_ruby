Question:
What does each method return in the following example?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)
answer: => 3
            This occurs because the argument is located at that index

2. arr.index[5]
answer: => undefined method
           this is incorrect syntax

3. arr[5]
answer: => 8
          This occurs because its the value from index 5
