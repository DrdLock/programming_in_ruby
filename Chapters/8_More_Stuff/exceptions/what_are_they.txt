Exception handling is used when errors are expected to arise
in specific parts of our program. These errors could happen for a variety of different
reasons but most commonly occur from unpredictable user interaction. We can choose how 
we handle these situations if they happen so our programs don't
crash with error codes. As a side note, this can also add a bit of security.

in ruby this is applied with the begin/rescue/end block. look examples at examples for
basic usage
