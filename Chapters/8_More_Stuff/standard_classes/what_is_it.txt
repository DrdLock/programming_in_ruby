Ruby standard classes are collections of libraries that allow you to solve 
more complex problems and basic problems more efficiently without having
to reinvent the wheel.
For example, the Math module has a list of various methods
that let you solve problems like sqrt(square root) PI(the number pi), cos(to evaluate the cosine of an angle),
amongst many others.
