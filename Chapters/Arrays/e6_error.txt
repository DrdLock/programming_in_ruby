You run the following code...
names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'
...and get the following error message:
TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

answer:
You attempted to change the name at index 3 to jody but you used a string as an index key. You can either change the syntax to names[3] = ‘jody’ or you can call names[-1] = 'jody'
