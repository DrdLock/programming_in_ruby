Question:
What does the following error message tell you?

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

Answer:
It’s saying that I accidentally put a closed parenthesis
instead of a closed bracket on line 2. This is most likely a block
statement not being properly closed
