Task:
Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

Answer:
Right now I have been exploring bot programming for my private discord server that my friends
and I chat and play games over. So I've really been enjoying learning how to work with the 
discordrb api. I haven't gotten much out of it yet, but I have managed to make a simple bot
that responds to certain messages in our chat thanks to the easily accesible documentation for 
the API.
