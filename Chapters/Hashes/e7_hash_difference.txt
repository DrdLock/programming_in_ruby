# Question
# Given the following code, what's the difference between
# the two hashes? What will they output?

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

Answer: 
my_hash will save space in memory because the key is of type symbol,
whereas my_hash2 is of type string, which takes up more space in memory.
