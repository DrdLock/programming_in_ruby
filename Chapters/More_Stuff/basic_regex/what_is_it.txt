# matching rules, they are then applied to a string to look for matches.
# These are commonly used for example:
# - to search the occurence of a character sequence in a string
# - to print out a specific list of a words contained in a sentence
# - to replace a specific sequence of characters with another
# - as well as other string manipulation tasks
