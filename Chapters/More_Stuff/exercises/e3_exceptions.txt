Question:
What is exception handling and how is it useful?

Answer:
Exception handling allows developers to have more control
over possible common errors that may occur during the flow
of program execution.These errors can occur most commonly 
from incorrect user input. 

This is especially useful to prevent program crashes or potential
exploitation of known possible vulnerabilities in your program that
may become visible to end users.
