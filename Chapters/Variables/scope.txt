Task:
Look at the following programs

x = 0

3.times do 
  x += 1
end
puts x

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

Question:
What does x print to the screen Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why? 

My original Answer:
For the first problem x is equal to 0 because it is using
the using the value of x outside of the method invocation

The second problem prints 3 because although y is assigned to x
in the method invocation, y's value was originally assigned outside
the method invocation

Correct Answer:
I was wrong about problem x. Incrementing x by 1 within the times
iteration saved its value to the variable outside its scope

I was correct about problem 2. The value of x was changed to the value of y
