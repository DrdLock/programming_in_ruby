# README #

This is git repository of all of my work that I have finished in the "Introduction to Programing with Ruby" e-book on the Launch School website.

I have provided the questions as well as my personal answers to all exercises in every chapter. Feel free to provide your own personal feedback on how I can improve my approaches to answering the various exercise problems.
